# Visualization and manipulation of temporal graphs

## Project status

Under development.

Start: 01/01/2024

End: 09/31/2024 (prediction)

## Description

Propose tools for manipulating temporal graphs related to automata and language theory, as well as adapted visualization tools.

## Objectives

- **Creation of software**: simple to use, covering several functionalities.
- **Portability**: portable software.
- **Automata theory orientation**: the goal being to use elements of automata/language theory to solve certain problems related to temporal graphs.

## Directory structure

**ChronoGraph**: Representation tool. All codes related to the implementation.

**Examples**: Set of examples to highlight the different features of the software.

## Prerequisites

- Temporal graphs
- Automata theory.
- Grammar/languages.

## Final products

**Research report**: A complete and detailed report.

**Representation tool**: A software tool.

**Technical documentation**: A complete documentation for the tool.
